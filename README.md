# Ola-Dashboard
I designed a multi-page Power BI dashboard to analyze OLA ride operations, covering booking trends, vehicle-type performance, revenue insights, cancellations, and rating distribution. The report highlights key KPIs such as total bookings, booking value, cancellation rates, top customers, and ride-distance patterns. Visual breakdowns help compare vehicle categories, payment preferences, and customer vs. driver ratings. Cancellation analysis reveals major causes from both users and drivers, supporting service improvement decisions. This dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor business performance, optimize fleet operations, and enhance customer experience through data-driven insights.
